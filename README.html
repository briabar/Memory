 <h1>Memory</h1>
 <p>Memory is the classic picture matching game that has been played all over the world.
 This version of memory is one that I coded for my Intro to Programming Nano Degree from Udacity.
 It is the capstone project of the course, and it uses javascript, jquery, html, and CSS.</p>
 <h2>How to Play</h2>
 <p>Open the included index.html file to run the game. The rules are the game are simple,
 click and reveal game tokens, attempt to remember the images revealed and match
 them in as few clicks as possible.</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<p>This implementation of Memory has several features.</p>
<h4>Reset Button</h4>
<p>At the top right there is a restart button, which will restart the game when
clicked, generating a new game board, and resetting all timers and scoreboards.</p>
<h4>Click Counter</h4>
<p>Below the game board there is a scoreboard which keeps track of the number
of clicks that have been made during the game.  Try to use the fewest number
of clicks possible.</p>
<h4>Star Rating</h4>
<p>Below the click counter are three stars which will score your skill level.
Try to get a star score of two or above!</p>
<h4>Timer</h4>
<p>At the very bottom of the screen is a timer.  Try to beat your time each time you play!</p>
<h2>Design Choices</h2>
<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>The game was designed using two overlapping grids of div elements.  These divs
are generated out of an array which links to the included image files. Game tokens
below are revealed by controlling visibility by adding and removing CSS through jquery.</p>
<h4>Fade Speed</h4>
<p>The fade speed of the tiles are fairly quick because I found that if they were too
slow it began to interfere with gameplay, and make clicking confusing.  After receiving
feedback on the project I did slow the fade time down to 1 second in and 1 second
out. </p>
<h4>Image Choice</h4>
<p>I chose images that were similar to each other in order to increase the difficulty.
 I wanted my game to be a real memory workout! </p>
 <h4>Star Counter</h4>
 <p>I chose to use the following values for my star counter: <br>
 0-20:  ★★★<br>
 21-25: ★★☆<br>
 26+:   ★☆☆<br>
 Since the minimun number of clicks required to win the game is 16 these seemed like reasonable amounts.</p>
